                <h3>Goals</h3>
                <p>Here at Momento, the goal is to create an experience for those suffering from memory issues, 
                    such as Dementia, a way to hold on to the memory of their loved ones longer. 
                    The first step in the plan is to create a pair of Facial Identification Glasses 
                    that leverage our brains ability to learn. The more certain-neurons activate the easier
                    it is for you to reactivate them. This is known as Neuro-Plasticity. The hope is that someone in
                    the early stages of dementia, through consistent and continous use of these glasses, will
                    be able to retain memory of the people they're talking to. </p>

                <h3>How it Started</h3>
                <p>This project all started in Sophomore year of High School. My STEM teacher tasks my group with this: 
                    "Come up with something that fixes an issue". It took a few days of brainstorming
                    and then there was an idea, an idea for a pair of glasses that show you who you're talking to. 
                    The problem was clear, not only were regular people susceptable to forgetting people,
                    but of course people with Dementia or Alzheimers would absoulutley benifit from this.
